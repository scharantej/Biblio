 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a book review website. The website should allow users to create accounts, write book reviews, and read reviews written by other users. The website should also have a search function so that users can easily find reviews of books they are interested in.

## Design

The website will be built using the Flask framework. The following HTML files will be needed:

* `index.html`: The home page of the website. This page will contain a list of the most recent book reviews.
* `login.html`: The login page. This page will allow users to enter their username and password to log in to the website.
* `register.html`: The registration page. This page will allow users to create a new account on the website.
* `book_review.html`: The page for writing a book review. This page will contain a form that users can use to submit their review.
* `book_reviews.html`: The page for displaying a list of book reviews. This page will contain a list of all the book reviews that have been submitted to the website.
* `search.html`: The page for searching for book reviews. This page will contain a form that users can use to search for reviews of specific books.

The following routes will be needed:

* `/`: The home page.
* `/login`: The login page.
* `/register`: The registration page.
* `/book_review`: The page for writing a book review.
* `/book_reviews`: The page for displaying a list of book reviews.
* `/search`: The page for searching for book reviews.
